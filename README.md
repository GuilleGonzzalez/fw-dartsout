# Darstout firmware

This repository contains the firmware needed to control a modified dartboard to play 'dartstout'.

This firmware is only compatible with the Dartsout PCB (link - TODO).

Currently, it is necessary to compile the firmware specifically for the desired dartboard.

## Future work:

- OTA updates.
- SSID and WiFi pass configuration.
- Configuration via WiFi (like Tasmota)
